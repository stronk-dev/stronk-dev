# ðŸªµ Stronk Overview

I am Marco, video streaming engineer, aspiring musician and owner of Stronk Tech: a software company with a dedication to release unlicensed, open-source software. On this page you can view all of our open-source contributions.

## Stronk Stats
*(unfortunately [the script](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) only indexes language usage of your own non-forked repo's, so 'Most Used Languages' is more 'Most used languages for personal side-projects')*
