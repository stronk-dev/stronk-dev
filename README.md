# ðŸªµ Stronk Overview

Hi, my name is Marco. I am a video streaming engineer, Livepeer orchestrator, multi-instrumentalist, and owner of Stronk Tech.

Everything I work on revolves around helping people ship reliable video infrastructure (and increasingly AI-driven workflows).

If you're planning a media or music project and need help with content delivery, media processing, AI or creative production, [reach out](https://www.stronk.tech/contact) and I'll loop in the MistServer crew (or the right collaborators from other circles).

## Stronk Stats
*(unfortunately [the script](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) only indexes language usage of your own non-forked repo's, so 'Most Used Languages' is more 'Most used languages for personal side-projects')*

## Workstreams

### MistServer - worlds first public domain media engine.

> The most efficient and flexible media server in existence, now completely open-source. Take control of your media pipeline and start building with MistServer!

We're one of the maintainers and co-owners of [MistServer](https://mistserver.com/), the media toolkit made by engineers, for engineers. MistServers' strength lies in it's *extreme*  versatility. It just works, no matter what media format you need to handle or device you want to turn into a streaming powerhouse.

Check out our [repository](https://github.com/DDVTECH/mistserver) and [documentation](https://docs.mistserver.org/) to get started for free, no strings attached!

If you need any help, feel free to [contact us](https://www.stronk.tech/contact) and we'll introduce you to the rest of the MistServer team to see how we can help you.

&nbsp;

### FrameWorks Network â€” Full-Stack Video Infrastructure

> Most streaming platforms lock you into their ecosystem. We give you the keys!

FrameWorks is the Special Purpose Entity the MistServer team runs for Livepeer. We dedicate engineering time to harden Livepeer's transcoding pipeline, maintain documentation and help teams launch on open infrastructure instead of being locked into cloud platforms. 

That means production-ready MistServer builds, active support for Livepeer node operators and a robust media platform people can self-host or co-build with us. Learn more at [frameworks.network](https://frameworks.network/).

&nbsp;

### Livepeer â€” World's Open Video Infrastructure

> Infrastructure for video computing, enabling AI processing and transcoding jobs to power the future of video.

I'm a long-time Livepeer contributor: past core team, current community moderator and operator of the second largest non-institutional validator node.

My Livepeer web apps and tooling live on [stronk.rocks](https://www.stronk.rocks/), and you can delegate to the node [here](https://explorer.livepeer.org/accounts/0x847791cbf03be716a7fe9dc8c9affe17bd49ae5e/delegating) to earn LPT + ETH while backing this work.

&nbsp;

### PatchPod Studio â€” Pack Light. Jam Heavy.

> Where creativity meets community. A modular music ecosystem that brings people together around authentic musical experiences, wherever inspiration strikes.

[PatchPod Studio](https://patchpod.studio/) is the mobile music lab I'm building: a compact kit that carries DAW rigs, synths, loopers, cameras, and streaming gear so we can drop a full studio into any venue.

The concept extends into PatchLab workshops, PatchStage pop-up shows, PatchBooth recording sessions, and PatchStream live setsâ€”all focused on hands-on music education and performance.

It's still in R&D while I lock in the modular layout, DSP chain and connectivity, but it's quickly becoming the music counterpart to my video infrastructure work.

&nbsp;

### StreamCrafter â€” Browser-Based Livestream Studio

> No installation. No configuration. No hassle. Just ultra low latency livestreaming straight from the browser.

[StreamCrafter](https://www.streamcrafter.live/) is our in-browser broadcasting studio. It's on the back burner while we push MistServer and FrameWorks, but the foundation is there and we're planning another product pass.

Developers can check out the [repo](https://github.com/DDVTECH/StreamCrafter) and [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@optimist-video/streamcrafter); we're always open to paid contributors with WebRTC experience.
